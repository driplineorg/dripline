On this page we collect features which have been discussed for upcoming versions of dripline. Once they are approved/implemented they will migrate from this page onto the proper pages in the spec itself. This could be considered similar to the discussion board for an issue tracker, but since this repo is already doing a bit too much, it seemed painful to mix in with technical issues.

In general, it is our goal that the dripline standard be stable, and that new user-space features be implemented within the constraints of the existing specs. Similarly, it is usually desirable to add new features not to the dripline library, but to derived applications (such as dragonfly or hornet) so that the dripline libraries themselves can be stable. Of course that does not always make sense, sometimes the conventions that exist fail to accommodate an arising need, or do so only in an ambiguous/messy way.

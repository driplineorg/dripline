Dripline sets specific requirements on the structure and content of messages, as well as dictating that certain behaviors be supported.
There is, by design, no strict instruction as to how those requirements are implemented and satisfied.
While this provides the flexibility to implement in any platform, it does not help one gain an intuition for how libraries will work.

Within implementation libraries within this organization, we will strive to provide a greater consistency in implementation patterns, described here.
This description will hopefully help in learning to use the libraries, and the consistency should make transitions between them go more smoothly.
